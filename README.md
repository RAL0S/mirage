# Mirage

 A powerful and modular framework dedicated to the security analysis of wireless communications. It currently provides :
    - multiple lightweight and hackable wireless protocol stacks (e.g. Bluetooth Low Energy, Enhanced ShockBurst, WiFi, Zigbee …)
    - multiple highly customizable offensive modules (e.g. Man-in-the-Middle, sniffing, jamming, hijacking, cloning …)
    - mutiple modules dedicated to information gathering (e.g. applicative layers dumping, scanning …)
    - mutiple experimental offensive modules based on InjectaBLE attack (e.g. Bluetooth Low Energy injection, Slave and Master hijacking, MiTM …)
    - a chaining operator allowing to easily combine attack modules in order to build complex attack workflows
    - support of multiple devices, such as HCI devices, Crazy Radio PA, RZUSBStick, BTLEJack, Nordic, Sniffle, ButteRFly and Ubertooth sniffers
    - an user-friendly development environment allowing to easily write new modules or customize existing ones
    - an experimental Software defined radio architecture, allowing to sniff and inject packets using HackRF One
